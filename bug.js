The Firebase Realtime Database client sometimes throws an error like "Failed to establish a connection" or similar messages, even when the network connectivity seems fine. This is often intermittent and hard to reproduce consistently.  The error may be related to network issues, Firebase server problems, or client-side configuration that blocks the connection. This might also manifest as a delay before a connection is successfully established leading to timeouts.
